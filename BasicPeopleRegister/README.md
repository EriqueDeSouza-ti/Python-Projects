# Basic People Register
This is a basic people register, it runs in terminal only. This is the first version, I intend to improve it!

## Folders
In this folder, you will find a python file called 'program.py'. This file runs the main program, and the are 3 more folders. The 'build' is the program build!
'dist' is where the .exe is! And finally, we have 'lib', this is a folder where it contains the modules of the program!

## Program
If you will run the .exe, you have to be aware that the software is in Portuguese pt-br. This is basically my first software and as I said before, I want to improve
my programming skills.

The main menu has 3 options, 1st option is 'Cadastrar Pessoa', in english 'Register person'. Basically it will ask the name ('Nome'), last name ('Sobrenome'), age ('Idade'), the year of birthday ('Ano de nascimento') and SSN ('CPF'). The 2nd option is 'Ver pessoas cadastradas' in english 'See Registered People'. You'll see the name, last name, age, year of birthday and SSN. For now, you can just view the registered people, and the program returns to the main menu. 3rd option is where you leave the program.
